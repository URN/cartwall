Cartwall v 0.4 by Thomas Preece

DESCRIPTION
===========

This is a cartwall program as used at URN. I'll write some better documentation
later.

To get it up and running, you will need an audio library (either GStreamer or
Audiere), and playstopaudio, which you can get from
https://github.com/tepreece/playstopaudio

Copy the 'playstopaudio' directory into this directory, or place it in your
Python site_packages directory. You will also need to drop a file called
"1.ogg" into this directory.

Then run ./cartwall.py to see what happens. You can change what carts are
played by editing cartwall.conf - although the file format is very opaque
at the moment. Improvements are in the pipeline right now.

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
==================

This software is intended primarily for use by student, community and 
other low-budget radio stations who can't afford professional cartwall 
software. Please note the "no warranty" clause in the licence - this 
means that if this software fails for whatever reason, you can't hold me
responsible or sue me for this.

You will probably only want to use this software if it's a choice 
between this and nothing at all: if you work for a big professional 
station and your cartwall crashing will get you in trouble or 
cause your organisation to lose lots of money, you can probably afford 
the professional equipment anyway - please use it. Otherwise, please 
read on.

BUGS AND TODO
=============

Documentation needs to be written.

It would be preferable to have a better configuration file format. This one was
designed to be very quickly generated and parsed by software, with little
regard for human-readability or backwards/forwards compatibility.

SUPPORT / CONTACT
=================

No formal technical support is available for this software, however I am 
generally happy to answer questions and provide some assistance with 
setting it up; if you need help, please don't hesitate to contact me. I 
always like hearing from users of my software, and would be very 
appreciative to hear from anyone who is using this software and finds it 
useful, especially if you're using it in a live broadcast environment. I 
also welcome patches for bugfixes and new features in the usual git 
format.
